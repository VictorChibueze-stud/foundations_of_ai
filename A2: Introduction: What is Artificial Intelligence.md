#### A2. Introduction: What is Artificial Intelligence?  
---

### A2.1 What is AI?  
**Key Concept**: Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
**Formal Definition**: AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include decision-making, problem-solving, learning, and understanding natural language.  

**Challenges in Defining AI**:  
- There is no universally accepted definition of AI.  
- Pragmatic definitions often prevail, such as:  
  - "AI is what AI researchers do."  
  - "AI is the solution of hard problems."  

**Common Attempts at Defining AI**:  
1. **Thinking Like Humans**: AI systems that mimic human thought processes.  
2. **Acting Like Humans**: AI systems that behave in ways indistinguishable from humans.  
3. **Thinking Rationally**: AI systems that use logical reasoning to solve problems.  
4. **Acting Rationally**: AI systems that make decisions to achieve the best possible outcomes.  

**Intuition**: The definition of AI often depends on the perspective of the researcher or practitioner. Some focus on replicating human behavior, while others prioritize logical reasoning or optimal decision-making.

### A2.2 Thinking Like Humans  
**Key Concept**: Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience  
**Formal Definition**: Cognitive science studies how humans think, while cognitive neuroscience focuses on the neural mechanisms underlying thought processes.  

**Approaches to Understanding Human Thought**:  
1. **Psychological Approach**: Observing human behavior to infer cognitive processes.  
2. **Neurological Approach**: Studying brain activity to understand how thoughts are generated.  

**Relevance to AI**:  
- Cognitive science and neuroscience provide insights into how humans think, which can inspire AI models.  
- However, these fields are distinct from AI, as AI does not necessarily aim to replicate human thought processes exactly.  

**Example**:  
- **Motor Cortex**: Responsible for voluntary movements.  
- **Sensory Cortex**: Processes sensory information.  
- **Parietal Lobe**: Integrates sensory information.  
- **Occipital Lobe**: Processes visual information.  
- **Cerebellum**: Coordinates movement and balance.  

**Intuition**: Understanding human thought processes can help design AI systems that mimic human intelligence, but AI can also achieve intelligence through other means, such as logical reasoning or optimization.

### A2.3 Acting Like Humans  
**Key Concept**: The Turing Test  
**Formal Definition**: Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, the Turing Test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.  

**Operationalization**:  
- A human interrogator interacts with both a human and a machine without knowing which is which.  
- If the interrogator cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.  

**Historical Context**:  
- **Eliza (1966)**: An early AI program that mimicked a psychotherapist, using pattern matching and scripted rules to simulate conversation.  
- **Loebner Prize (1991â€“2019)**: An annual competition to award the most human-like AI.  
- **Eugene Goostman (2014)**: A chatbot that mimicked a 13-year-old boy and convinced 33% of judges it was human.  
- **Kuki (formerly Mitsuku)**: A chatbot that won multiple Loebner Prize competitions.  
- **Google Duplex (2018)**: An AI system that autonomously makes phone calls, such as booking appointments.  
- **LaMDA & ChatGPT**: Modern AI systems capable of engaging in human-like conversations.  

**Criticism of the Turing Test**:  
- The test focuses on imitation rather than genuine intelligence.  
- It may reward deceptive behavior rather than true understanding.  
- Results are not always reproducible, and the test may be more about the interrogator's perception than the AI's capabilities.  

**Practical Application**:  
- **CAPTCHA**: A reverse Turing test used to distinguish humans from machines.  

**Intuition**: The Turing Test remains a influential concept in AI, but it has limitations in assessing true intelligence.

### A2.4 Thinking Rationally  
**Key Concept**: Logical Reasoning  
**Formal Definition**: Thinking rationally involves using logical rules to derive conclusions from given premises.  

**Historical Context**:  
- **Aristotle**: Developed the concept of syllogisms, which are logical structures that yield correct conclusions from correct premises.  
  - Example:  
    - Premise 1: Socrates is a human.  
    - Premise 2: All humans are mortal.  
    - Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.  

**Connection to AI**:  
- Modern AI systems often use mathematical logic to perform reasoning tasks.  

**Limitations of Logical Reasoning**:  
- Not all intelligent behavior stems from logical thinking.  
- Human reasoning often involves intuition, creativity, and other non-logical processes.  

**Intuition**: While logical reasoning is a powerful tool in AI, it is not sufficient to capture the full range of human intelligence.

### A2.5 Acting Rationally  
**Key Concept**: Rational Agents  
**Formal Definition**: A rational agent is one that acts to achieve the best possible outcome, given the available information.  

**Key Principles**:  
- **Utility Maximization**: The agent aims to maximize its utility, or the measure of success in achieving its goals.  
- **Rationality Does Not Require Thought**: Reflexes and other automatic behaviors can also be rational if they lead to optimal outcomes.  

**Advantages of Rational Agents**:  
- More general than approaches based on human thinking or logical reasoning.  
- Better suited for scientific methods, as rationality can be formally defined and measured.  

**Intuition**: The concept of rational agents is central to modern AI, as it provides a framework for designing systems that make optimal decisions in complex environments.

### A2.6 Summary  
**Key Takeaways**:  
- AI can be defined in multiple ways, depending on whether it focuses on human-like behavior, logical reasoning, or rational decision-making.  
- The four main perspectives on AI are:  
  1. **Acting Like Humans**: Focuses on behavior that is indistinguishable from human behavior (e.g., Turing Test).  
  2. **Thinking Like Humans**: Focuses on replicating human thought processes (e.g., cognitive science).  
  3. **Thinking Rationally**: Focuses on logical reasoning (e.g., syllogisms).  
  4. **Acting Rationally**: Focuses on making optimal decisions to achieve goals (e.g., rational agents).  
- The most common view in AI today is the rational agent approach, as it is amenable to scientific methods and provides a general framework for AI development.  

**Intuition**: The field of AI is diverse, with different approaches emphasizing different aspects of intelligence. The rational agent perspective is widely adopted because it provides a clear and measurable framework for designing intelligent systems.
