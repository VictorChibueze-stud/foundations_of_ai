### **A5.1 Environments of Rational Agents**

#### **Introduction to Environments**
In artificial intelligence (AI), the environment is the external context in which an agent operates. The agent interacts with the environment through sensors (to observe) and actuators (to act). The environment is critical because it determines the nature of the problem the agent must solve. 

Key questions to consider when analyzing an environment:
1. **Which aspects of the environment are relevant for the agent?**  
   The agent must understand which parts of the environment affect its performance and decision-making.
   
2. **How do the agent’s actions change the environment?**  
   The agent’s actions can alter the state of the environment, and the agent must anticipate these changes to make effective decisions.
   
3. **What does the agent observe?**  
   The agent’s observations are limited by its sensors, and these observations may not always provide a complete picture of the environment.

#### **Properties of Environments**
The properties of an environment determine the complexity of the AI problem and the type of algorithms that can be used to solve it. Here are the key properties:

1. **Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable**  
   - **Fully Observable**: The agent can perceive the complete state of the environment at every decision point.  
   - **Partially Observable**: The agent only has access to partial information about the environment. A special case is **unobservable**, where the agent has no direct access to the environment’s state.

2. **Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent**  
   - **Single-Agent**: Only one agent is acting in the environment.  
   - **Multi-Agent**: Multiple agents interact in the environment. These agents can be **adversarial** (competing against each other), **cooperative** (working together), or **selfish** (acting in their own interest).

3. **Deterministic vs. Nondeterministic vs. Stochastic**  
   - **Deterministic**: The next state of the environment is entirely determined by the current state and the agent’s action.  
   - **Nondeterministic**: The next state is not fully predictable, but there are no probabilities involved.  
   - **Stochastic**: Probabilities are involved in determining the next state of the environment.

4. **Static vs. Dynamic**  
   - **Static**: The environment does not change while the agent is deciding on its next action.  
   - **Dynamic**: The environment can change while the agent is deliberating, requiring the agent to adapt quickly.

5. **Discrete vs. Continuous**  
   - **Discrete**: The environment’s state, actions, observations, and time are represented by discrete values.  
   - **Continuous**: These aspects are represented by continuous values, which often require more complex mathematical models.

#### **Real-World Environments**
The real world combines many of the challenging properties mentioned above. It is often partially observable, dynamic, stochastic, and continuous, making it one of the most difficult environments for AI systems to handle.

### **A5.2 Problem Solving Methods**

#### **Three Approaches to Solving AI Problems**
When faced with an AI problem (e.g., playing backgammon), there are three main approaches to solving it:

1. **Problem-Specific Algorithms**  
   - These are algorithms designed specifically for a particular problem.  
   - **Advantages**: They can exploit problem-specific knowledge, often leading to highly efficient solutions.  
   - **Disadvantages**: They are limited to solving only one type of problem and cannot be generalized to other domains.

2. **General Problem Solvers**  
   - In this approach, the user creates a model of the problem instance using a formal language or formalism.  
   - The solver takes this model as input and applies a general algorithm to compute a solution.  
   - **Advantages**: These solvers are versatile and can handle a wide range of problems.  
   - **Disadvantages**: They may not be as efficient as problem-specific algorithms, especially for highly specialized tasks.

3. **Learning-Based Approaches**  
   - Instead of relying on pre-programmed algorithms, the agent learns how to solve the problem through experience.  
   - This approach requires data and feedback, rather than a detailed model of the problem.  
   - **Advantages**: Learning-based methods can adapt to new situations and improve over time.  
   - **Disadvantages**: They require large amounts of data and may not always generalize well to unseen scenarios.

#### **Combining Approaches**
In practice, it is common to combine these approaches. For example, a general problem solver might be enhanced with learning techniques to improve its performance. While this course will primarily focus on general algorithms, we will also explore other approaches where relevant.

### **A5.3 Classification of AI Topics**

#### **Classification Based on Environment and Problem Solving Methods**
AI topics can be classified based on the properties of the environments they deal with and the problem-solving methods they employ. Below are some examples:

1. **Informed Search Algorithms**  
   - **Environment**: Typically static, deterministic, fully observable, discrete, and single-agent.  
   - **Problem Solving Method**: General algorithms are often used, but problem-specific methods can also be applied.

2. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**  
   - **Environment**: Static, deterministic, fully observable, discrete, and single-agent.  
   - **Problem Solving Method**: General solvers are commonly used, but learning methods can also be applied in some cases.

3. **Board Games**  
   - **Environment**: Static, deterministic, fully observable, discrete, and multi-agent (often adversarial).  
   - **Problem Solving Method**: Problem-specific algorithms (e.g., minimax for chess) are common, but general solvers and learning methods (e.g., reinforcement learning) are also used.

4. **Classical Planning**  
   - **Environment**: Static, deterministic, fully observable, discrete, and single-agent.  
   - **Problem Solving Method**: General planning algorithms are typically used.

5. **Acting Under Uncertainty**  
   - **Environment**: Often dynamic, stochastic, partially observable, and continuous.  
   - **Problem Solving Method**: Learning methods (e.g., Bayesian networks) are commonly used, but general algorithms can also be applied.

6. **Advanced Topics**  
   - **General Game Playing**: Involves environments that can be static or dynamic, deterministic or stochastic, fully or partially observable, discrete or continuous, and single or multi-agent. The problem-solving method is typically general, but learning methods are also used.  
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Involves dynamic, stochastic, partially observable, and continuous environments. The problem-solving method is primarily learning-based.

### **Summary**

1. **AI Problem Components**: An AI problem consists of a performance measure, an agent model, and an environment. The properties of the environment (static vs. dynamic, deterministic vs. stochastic, etc.) are critical in determining the appropriate problem-solving method.

2. **Problem Solving Methods**: There are three main approaches:  
   - **Problem-Specific**: Tailored to a specific problem.  
   - **General**: Uses a formal model of the problem and applies a general algorithm.  
   - **Learning**: The agent learns to solve the problem through experience and data.

3. **Classification of AI Topics**: AI topics can be classified based on the properties of the environments they deal with and the problem-solving methods they use. Examples include informed search, constraint satisfaction, board games, and reinforcement learning.
