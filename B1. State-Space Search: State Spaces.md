## B1.1 State-Space Search Problems

### Overview of State-Space Search
State-space search is a fundamental problem-solving approach in artificial intelligence. It involves exploring a set of states and transitions to determine a sequence of actions that lead from an initial state to a goal state.

### Applications of State-Space Search
State-space search is widely applied in:
- **Pathfinding**: Used in robotics, navigation, and game AI (e.g., Mario AI competition, multi-agent pathfinding).
- **Scheduling**: Task planning in logistics and software verification.
- **NPC Behavior**: AI-controlled non-player character decision-making in games.

### Classical Assumptions
For simplicity, we consider a **classical** state-space search problem with the following assumptions:
- **Single-agent environment**: No other agents influence the search.
- **Fully observable environment**: The agent has complete knowledge of the world state.
- **Static environment**: The world remains unchanged unless modified by the agent.
- **Finite and discrete state space**: The problem consists of a finite number of states and actions.
- **Deterministic transitions**: The outcome of each action is predictable.

These assumptions can be generalized, but this discussion focuses on the classical case.

### Problem Definition
A **state-space search problem** consists of:
1. An **initial state**
2. A **goal state** or goal conditions
3. A set of **actions** applicable in different states
4. A **transition function** that defines how actions modify states
5. A **cost function** that assigns a numerical cost to each action

The objective is to find an optimal path from the initial state to a goal state that minimizes total action cost.

### Example: The 15-Puzzle
A common example of a state-space search problem is the **15-puzzle**, where tiles must be rearranged into a correct order by sliding them within a grid.

## B1.2 Formalization

### Definition of State Spaces
A **state space** (also called a transition system) is formally defined as a **6-tuple**:
\[ S = \langle S, A, \text{cost}, T, s_I, S_G \rangle \]
where:
- **\(S\)**: Finite set of possible states.
- **\(A\)**: Finite set of possible actions.
- **\(\text{cost}: A \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)**: Function assigning a non-negative cost to each action.
- **\(T \subseteq S \times A \times S\)**: A transition relation where each state-action pair leads to a unique successor state.
- **\(s_I \in S\)**: The initial state.
- **\(S_G \subseteq S\)**: The set of goal states.

### State-Space Transitions
- A **transition** \( (s, a, s') \in T \) represents moving from state \(s\) to state \(s'\) using action \(a\).
- Transitions are **deterministic**, meaning a given action in a given state always leads to a unique successor state.

### Example: Bounded Inc-and-Square Search
Consider a number modification problem where actions **increment modulo 10** and **square modulo 10**:
- **States**: \( S = \{0, 1, ..., 9\} \)
- **Actions**: \( A = \{ \text{inc}, \text{sqr} \} \)
- **Transition Function**:
  - \( \langle i, \text{inc}, (i+1) \mod 10 \rangle \in T \)
  - \( \langle i, \text{sqr}, i^2 \mod 10 \rangle \in T \)
- **Initial State**: \( s_I = 1 \)
- **Goal States**: \( S_G = \{6, 7\} \)
- **Cost**: Each action costs 1.

### Graph Representation of State Spaces
State spaces can be represented as directed graphs:
- **Nodes** represent states.
- **Edges** represent transitions labeled by actions.
- **Initial State** is marked with an incoming arrow.
- **Goal States** are represented as double circles.

### Paths and Solutions
- A **path** from state \(s_0\) to state \(s_n\) is a sequence of actions that transforms \(s_0\) into \(s_n\).
- A **solution** is a path that leads to a goal state.
- An **optimal solution** has the minimal cost among all solutions.

## B1.3 State-Space Search

### Definition
**State-space search** is the problem of systematically exploring a state space to find a solution path or proving that no solution exists.

### Solving Search Problems
To solve a state-space search problem, one must determine:
1. A **sequence of actions** that transforms the initial state into a goal state.
2. The **optimal sequence** (if optimizing for cost).

### Learning Objectives for State-Space Search
By studying state-space search, one should be able to:
- Define and formalize search problems.
- Evaluate search algorithms in terms of **completeness, optimality, time complexity, and space complexity**.
- Differentiate between **uninformed and informed search algorithms**.
- Analyze and design heuristics for efficient state-space exploration.
- Implement and experimentally evaluate search algorithms.
